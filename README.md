# 🎈 ML500 Helm Charts

This repository contains a collection of Helm charts designed to support the ML500 MLOps Enablement Workshop. These charts facilitate the deployment of essential components and services required throughout the workshop.

Additionally, the workshop leverages Helm charts from the [Red Hat CoP Helm Charts](https://github.com/redhat-cop/helm-charts/) repository to complement the deployment process.
